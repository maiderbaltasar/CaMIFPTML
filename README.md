Abstract. Calmodulin is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases which makes it an interesting area of research. Understanding these conditions at a molecular level, particularly how calmodulin interacts with various signalling molecules, is vital for developing targeted therapies. In this context, this research focused on developing a machine learning model to predict the efficacy of different assays and drugs of diseases related to CaM under different boundary conditions.  To achieve this, we compiled a comprehensive dataset including commercialized drugs and experimental compounds targeting CaM complexes. We employed statistical models, specifically following the IFPTML pathway, to identify key factors influencing these activities. Furthermore, a case study on riluzole derivatives was conducted. Riluzole was chosen as target drug for its significant role in modulating Ca2+-dependent interactions between calmodulin and target proteins. The study involved synthesizing riluzole derivatives, performing biological assays, and conducting docking studies to evaluate their efficacy. The predictive model developed was then applied to assess these derivatives, demonstrating its practical utility in predicting their potential as therapeutic agents. This research not only advances our understanding of CaM-related diseases but also provides a framework for developing new treatments based on predictive modelling.
